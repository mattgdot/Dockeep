Tired of losing track of important files on your phone? PDFs, ID copies, class notes, or anything shared with you often get buried in Downloads, WhatsApp or email attachments. 
I built this app as a student who wanted a simple, private way to keep everything organized and easy to access.

With Dockeep, you can share any file from any app directly into a folder you choose. It’s like a pocket for your files: quick to save, easy to search, and always under your control.

Key features
- Share files from any app into your own folders
- Search to find files instantly
- Keep everything private, local, and ad-free

It’s free, open-source, and still early, but I’d love to keep improving it with feedback or contributions.
