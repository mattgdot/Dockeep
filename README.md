# Dockeep
## Keep what matters. Save what's yours. 

A simple, open-source Android app to keep your important files organized and easy to find. I built this as a student who was tired of losing track of important documents. Now I have a single, private space where I can save anything and access it anytime.

It’s free, open-source, and still early, but I’m happy to keep improving it if there’s interest. Contributions, feedback, and feature suggestions are welcome!
