## 1. Data Collection and Use
Dockeep does **not collect, store, process, or transmit any personal data**.

- The App does not collect personally identifiable information such as name, email address, or contact details.

## 2. File Management and Security
Dockeep functions as a local file manager and synchronization tool with cloud storage services chosen by the user.

- All files remain under the sole control of the user.  
- Dockeep does not share, transfer, or otherwise access user files, except where the user explicitly connects to a third-party service.  
- As an additional security measure, the App provides the option to **encrypt files** and protect them with a **user-defined password** or with the device’s **biometric authentication system**. These protections are fully under the user’s control.

## 3. Third-Party Services
If the user chooses to integrate Dockeep with third-party cloud storage providers, all interactions with such services are subject to the respective provider’s **Terms of Service** and **Privacy Policy**.  
Dockeep does not store login credentials or otherwise process authentication details beyond the user’s device.

## 4. Security Practices
Because Dockeep does not collect or transmit personal data, all information remains on the user’s device or within the third-party cloud services selected by the user.  
The App implements industry-standard practices to ensure that optional encryption and authentication features operate securely.
